pyrenamer
---------
pyrenamer is a tool designed to aid in the management of a large media
library. It does this by automatically renaming media files so that they
can be easily parsed by Plex/Kodi. This tool is now depreciated and has been
superseded by [Yet Another Media Renamer](https://github.com/jamesl33/yamr).
